# RepairManager2021
Showcase of 2021 - Semester 2. Initial Commit

RepairManager 2021 is my schoolproject for the 2nd time in the 2nd semester. It is designed to manage and handle repair requests, needs, and parts within a building.

Feel free to dig around. please let me know if there's some strange stuff going on! I'm still learning, so I like to take all that I can get.
